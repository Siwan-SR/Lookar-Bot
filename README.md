# Lookar-Bot
Lookar Bot is like a discord bot but simpler and is not a discord bot.

This bot has a lot of commands, though it is still under developement.

I have made it so that blacklisted words can't be entered as an input. It will exit the program as soon as it triggers. 

The bot was made by replit. Replit: https://replit.com/

Why Replit?

Replit is a multi - program supporter, meaning you can write whatever you want. Besides it's a browser IDE so you don't have to worry about losing your works. Even though it can always be pushed to GitHub its very good.

(P.S: This is not a promotion for Replit. I am just telling what browser IDE I use. Credits to Replit for making Replit.)
